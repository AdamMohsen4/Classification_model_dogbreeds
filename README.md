# Dog Breed Classification Using Decision Tree

This project demonstrates how to classify dog breeds using a decision tree classifier. It utilizes a combination of preprocessing techniques, a scikit-learn pipeline, and a dataset of dog breeds to predict the type of dog based on its features.

## Overview
The aim of this project is to classify dog breeds into specific categories (e.g., Sporting, Hound, Toy, etc.) based on various attributes such as size, exercise requirements, lifespan, and grooming needs. The trained model uses entropy to split decision tree nodes and achieves measurable accuracy.

## Features
- Preprocessing using pipelines (OneHotEncoder for categorical and StandardScaler for numerical data).
- Decision tree classification using scikit-learn.
- Visualization of the decision tree for better interpretability.

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - pydotplus
  - IPython
  - matplotlib
